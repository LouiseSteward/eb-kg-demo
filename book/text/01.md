# **1** Hello World

We can either save the graphs as JSON to `_kg/graphs` or save the graphs as JSON *or* yaml in `_data/kg` and do:

{% raw %}
``` liquid
{% include kg graph="elasticity--demand-elasticity--constant-slope" %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% include kg graph="elasticity--demand-elasticity--constant-slope" link="http://example.com" %}

There are notes on usage and technical challenges in the plugin readme [here](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-plugin-kg#readme).
