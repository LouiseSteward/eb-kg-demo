# **1** Hello World

This is a demo of KineticGraphs in an Electric Book project using [an EB plugin](https://github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-plugin-kg).

Save graphs as JSON or yaml to `_kg/graphs`:

{% raw %}
``` liquid
{% include kg graph="test.yml" %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% include kg graph="test.yml" link="http://example.com" %}

{% raw %}
``` liquid
{% include kg graph="test.json" %}
```
{% endraw %}

{% include kg graph="test.json" %}

Optionally, save graphs as JSON or yaml in `_data/kg` by changing the relevant variable in `_includes/kg`.
